# Sales-Forecasting-Excel-ETS
Validated sales forecasting model in Excel (ETS vs MA), achieving 17.64% MAPE and 42% error reduction over baseline.

## Sales Forecasting using Excel (ETS vs Moving Average)
## Project Overview

   This project demonstrates time-series sales forecasting using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to compare a baseline Moving Average model with an Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model using proper train-test        validation.

## Workflow

  Data cleaning and monthly aggregation

  Feature engineering (Lag, 3-Month Moving Average, Growth Rate)

  Time-based Train/Test split

  ETS forecasting using Excel's FORECAST.ETS()

  Baseline comparison with Moving Average

  Model evaluation using MAPE

  Interactive Dashboard for visualization

  ## Model Performance

| Model | MAPE |
|--------|--------|
| ETS | 17.64% |
| 3-Month Moving Average | 30.61% |

ETS reduced forecast error by approximately 42% compared to the baseline model.


🛠 Tools Used

  Microsoft Excel

  Time Series Analysis

  Error Metrics (MAPE)

  Dashboard Design

🎯 Key Insights

  The ETS model captured seasonality and trend more effectively than a simple moving average, demonstrating the importance of model validation and baseline benchmarking.
